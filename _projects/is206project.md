#### Purpose and Scope
This project consists of designing and creating an IMDb-esque movie reviews and ratings database---a platform for users to be able to access basic movie information such as cast and crew information, genre, and roles while also writing reviews, ratings, and interacting with other usersâ€™ posts. The purpose for the database is to enhance the movie experience for users with up-to-date movie details while providing insight into what kinds of movies or media resonate the most with audiences and the general public. 

#### Entity-Relationship Diagram
This diagram, created with [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com), highlights the key entities, attributes, primary keys, and relationships for the database schema.

#### Creation of Database
Here are some of the tables created with SQLite.
```
CREATE TABLE Movie(id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        title varchar(100),
        year INT,
        release_date varchar(100),
        duration INT,
        country varchar(100),
        worldwide_gross_income INT,
        languages varchar(100),
        production_company varchar(100)
    );

CREATE TABLE Genre(movie_id varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY,
        genre_name varchar(100)
    );

CREATE TABLE Ratings(movie_id varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY, 
        avg_rating INT, 
        total_votes INT,
        median_rating varchar(100)
    );

CREATE TABLE Actors(id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name_id varchar(100), 
        height INT,
        date_of_birth varchar(100), 
        movies_known_for varchar(100)
