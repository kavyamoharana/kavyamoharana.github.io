## Assessing Climate Change and Global Temperature Trends Over Time
*Final project for IS 327: Concepts of Machine Learning at UIUC*

#### Purpose and Problem Description
The Climate Crisis is one of the most critical and urgent issues of our time. For most of history there has been a general lack in well-funded, proper climate change related research. Machine Learning approaches to global warming problems can provide more nuanced insights into climate patterns, complexities of global temperature trends, and help predict future climate scenarios.

#### Exploring the [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/) Global Temperatures Dataset
For this project, I analyzed a collection of global surface temperature data from Berkeley Earth (associated with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), an independent U.S. non-profit organization focused on environmental data science and analysis. Berkeley Earth provides a large range of temperature readings from around the year 1750 to 2015 that was split into datasets by country, state, major city, and land versus ocean temperatures in a packaged [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) on Kaggle. My primary focus was to analyze the **LandAverageTemperature** variable within the global, country-based, and major cities datasets. 

##### *Research Question*
##### **What are the long-term trends in global surface temperatures and how do temperature patterns vary in different regions over time?**
<br>

#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

#### 2. Linear Regression

#### 3. K-Means Clustering
