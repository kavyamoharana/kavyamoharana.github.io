#### Purpose
Binged is a social cataloging or tracking app for TV shows which serves as a more user-friendly redesign for many of the existing platforms that I have used. The purpose of this application was to provide a social platform for TV enthusiasts to engage more with the content of their favorite series and enhance the watching experience by being able to track, log, review, and rate episodes or create lists as well. This app serves as a more user-friendly and visually appealing redesign for many of the existing platforms that I have used such as [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), [TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com/), or [Serialzd](https://www.serializd.com/). 

#### End User Persona
- Age: 14 years or older
- Interests: enthusiastic about TV and social media platforms, old enough to understand necessary cautions and etiquette of social media
- Goals: to keep track of TV media they are currently watching or want to watch in a fun way, engage with other viewers or fans of TV shows
