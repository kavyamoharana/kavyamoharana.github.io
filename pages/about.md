# **About Me**
---
I am a fourth-year [Information Sciences + Data Science](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/undergraduate/bs-data-science) student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Pursuing a human-centered and data-driven major as well as a more technical **Computer Science** minor, I am passionate about Data Analytics and Visualization, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing! I am also a part of the Misinformation Detection on Tiktok Team under UIUC's [Center of Health Informatics](https://chi.healtheng.illinois.edu/projects/chime-in-illinois/), working on an AI-based social media analysis tool.
